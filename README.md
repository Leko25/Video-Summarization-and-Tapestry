# MultimediaSystemsProject
Final Project of CSCI576

TASKS:

Primary Tasks:
- Creating a video player given the images file and sound file.
- Creating a gui to interact with the video
- Taking a frame from each video and using it to play the video.

Challenges:
- Audio and video synchronization.
- This forms the back bone of our project hence very critical.

Secondary Tasks:
- Coming up with Algorithm to create a synopsis image.
- Integrating the algorithm with our gui.

Challenges:
- Open ended challenge, need to test lots of ideas.

Timeline:
- Finish Primary Tasks by 27th April, Finish Secondary tasks in 3 days and iterate as needed.

Comments:
- Since secondary task is an offline process, we can do it in any language needed.
- Primary task needs to be realtime and without delays, so probably will be good with C++. It can be done with Qt5
- A simple version of secondary task can be finished in hours, but a really good one with sophisticated techniques can take days. 
- Since you have good machine learning experience, it would be helpful if you come up with something along those lines.
